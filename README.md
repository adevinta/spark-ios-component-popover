# Popover

## Specifications

The popover specifications on Zeroheight is [here](https://zeroheight.com/1186e1705/v/latest/p/88a08c-popover).

Popover is available for all versions in UIKit.  
Popover is availabe starting iOS 16.4 in SwiftUI.

## UIKit

### Usage

Spark's approach is heavily relying on the native UIKit `popoverPresentationController`.  
The API is very similar.

```swift
public extension UIViewController {

    /// Presents a Spark Popover modally.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - popoverViewControllerToPresent: The Spark Popover to display over the current view controllerâ€™s content
    ///   - sourceView: UIPopoverPresentationController.sourceView
    ///   - sourceRect: UIPopoverPresentationController.sourceRect
    ///   - permittedArrowDirections: UIPopoverPresentationController.permittedArrowDirections
    ///   - flag: Pass true to animate the presentation; otherwise, pass false.
    ///   - completion: The block to execute after the presentation finishes. This block has no return value and takes no parameters. You may specify nil for this parameter.
    func presentPopover(
        _ popoverViewControllerToPresent: PopoverViewController,
        sourceView: UIView,
        sourceRect: CGRect? = nil,
        permittedArrowDirections: UIPopoverArrowDirection = .any,
        animated flag: Bool = true,
        completion: (() -> Void)? = nil
    )

}
```

### PopoverViewController

To define the Popover's content, consumers will need to provide a PopoverViewController with its content.

```swift
/// ViewController used as a container for the content of a Popover
/// It handles the background configuration such as color, inner spacings and the drawing of the arrow if needed
/// The content viewController is defined by the consumer, it should have a .clear background, no padding and have a well defined preferredContentSize for the popover to calculate its size properly
public final class PopoverViewController: UIViewController, UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate {

    /// PopoverViewController initializer
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - contentViewController: The viewController that will be embedded in the popover: it should have a .clear background, no padding and have a well defined preferredContentSize for the popover to calculate its size properly
    ///   - theme: The theme of a Popover
    ///   - intent: The intent of the Popover
    ///   - showArrow: Boolean used to show or hide the tip arrow of the Popover
    public convenience init(
        contentViewController: UIViewController,
        theme: any Theme, 
        intent: PopoverIntent, 
        showArrow: Bool = true
    )

}
```

## SwiftUI

The same way as for UIKit, Spark's SwiftUI Popover builds upon the native one

```swift
public extension View {
    @available(iOS 16.4, *)
    /// Presents a Spark popover when a given condition is true.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - theme: The Spark theme of the Spark popover.
    ///   - intent: The Spark intent of the Spark popover.
    ///   - isPresented: A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether
    ///     to present the popover content that you return from the modifier's
    ///     `content` closure.
    ///   - attachmentAnchor: The positioning anchor that defines the
    ///     attachment point of the popover. The default is
    ///     ``Anchor/Source/bounds``.
    ///   - arrowEdge: The edge of the `attachmentAnchor` that defines the
    ///     location of the popover's arrow in macOS. The default is ``Edge/top``.
    ///     iOS ignores this parameter.
    ///   - content: A closure returning the content of the popover.
    ///     It has a `PopoverColors` as a parameter.
    func popover<Content>(
        theme: any Theme,
        intent: PopoverIntent,
        isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
        attachmentAnchor: PopoverAttachmentAnchor = .rect(.bounds),
        arrowEdge: Edge = .top,
        @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (PopoverColors) -> Content
    ) -> some View where Content: View
}
```

## Content configuration

To help you configure your content's colors accordingly to the intent, use `PopoverIntent.getColors(theme:)`
```swift
/// Intent used to { get set } background & foreground colors on the popover
public enum PopoverIntent: CaseIterable {

    case surface
    case main
    case support
    case accent
    case basic
    case success
    case alert
    case error
    case info
    case neutral

    /// Get the colors to apply on popovers from an intent
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - theme: Spark theme
    /// - Returns: PopoverColors
    public func getColors(theme: Theme) -> PopoverColors

}

public struct PopoverColors {

    /// Popover background color
    public let background: any ColorToken
    /// Popover foreground color
    public let foreground: any ColorToken

}
```
